# Simple PHP Views

## What

A simple PHP class for creating lightweight renderable views for alacarte PHP frameworks. Template languages certainly have their place, but it turns out PHP is great at printing out strings too!

## Usage

### Installing

Composer is by far the easiest way to install Views.

```sh
composer require journey/views ~0.1
```

### Rendering Views

Creating and using views is easy-easy:

```php
// Here's one way:
$view = new Journey\Views('template-file', $variables);
echo $view->render();

// Here's another:
$view = Journey\Views::make('template-file', $variables);
echo $view->render();

// The quickest
echo Journey\Views::make('template-file', $variables);
```

Key value pairs in the $variables array will be extracted for use in the template file. You can also choose to prefix your variables with the `variable_prefix` option. Of course views can easily be nested as well.

### Configuration

Generally you'll want to configure the default values for your entire installation sometime around boot:

```php
    Journey\View::defaults([
        'templates' => getcwd() . "/templates",
        'extension' => '.php',
        'variable_prefix' => null,
        'string_template' => false
    ]);
```

However you can also set per-instance configuration values:

```php
// Lets render the file /tmp/temporary-file.php
$view = new Journey\View('temporary-file');
$view->config(['templates' => '/tmp']);
echo $view;
```
